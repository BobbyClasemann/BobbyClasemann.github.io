Squarespace allowed us, without any knowledge of HTML, to design a complex, content rich web site and then to focus on putting out a magazine, not keeping our web site running. It is highly advanced and flexible, but demands only a layman's knowledge of the internet to operate. Technical support is responsive, quick, and intelligible. <strong>I can't imagine running New Partisan without it.</strong>
